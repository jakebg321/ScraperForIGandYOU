# README / Setup Instructions for Scraper Project

## Introduction
This document will guide you through setting up the scraper project from GitHub. It is intended for users who may not be familiar with VSCode or Python development. The instructions cover both Windows and Mac environments, including installing Python, setting up a virtual environment, installing required packages, and troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11.9**
  - You need to have Python 3.11.9 installed.
  - Download it from [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/).
  - During installation on Windows, make sure to check **Add Python to PATH**.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac) and clone the Git repository:

#### Windows Command Prompt
```cmd
:: Clone the repository to a directory called scraperfromGit
git clone https://github.com/jakebg321/ScraperForIGandYOU.git scraperfromGit
```

#### Mac Terminal
```bash
# Clone the repository to a directory called scraperfromGit
git clone https://github.com/jakebg321/ScraperForIGandYOU.git scraperfromGit
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the project directory:

```cmd
cd scraperfromGit
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment
Creating a virtual environment will help manage dependencies separately from other Python projects.

#### Windows Command Prompt
```cmd
py -m venv venv
```

#### Mac Terminal
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 4. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment to install dependencies in an isolated environment.

#### Windows Command Prompt
```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Mac Terminal
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 5. Install Dependencies
Install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Running the Script
After setting up, you can run the script with Python:

```cmd
python your_script_name.py
```

### 7. Troubleshooting Playwright Installation
If you encounter any issues with **Playwright**, you might need to install its browser binaries separately:

#### Windows & Mac
```cmd
playwright install
```

If Playwright gives you a permissions-related error on Mac, you may need to run the following command with elevated privileges:

```bash
sudo playwright install
```

### 8. Deactivating the Virtual Environment
Once you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment:

```cmd
deactivate
```

## Summary of Commands to Copy & Paste

### For Windows:
```cmd
:: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jakebg321/ScraperForIGandYOU.git scraperfromGit

:: Change to project directory
cd scraperfromGit

:: Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

:: Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate

:: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

:: Install Playwright (if needed)
playwright install
```

### For Mac:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jakebg321/ScraperForIGandYOU.git scraperfromGit

# Change to project directory
cd scraperfromGit

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright (if needed)
sudo playwright install
```

## Additional Notes
- **VSCode Usage**: If you're new to VSCode, you can open the project folder (`scraperfromGit`) by clicking **File -> Open Folder** and selecting the folder.
- **Python Version**: Make sure you use Python **3.11.9** or above for compatibility with the project dependencies.
